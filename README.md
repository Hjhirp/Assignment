# Structify.ai Problem Solution Repository

Welcome to the GitHub repository containing the solution for the problem statement presented by Structify.ai. This repository is structured to provide a clear and efficient solution to the given problem, leveraging mathematical principles and algorithmic design to achieve the desired outcomes.

## Overview

The solution revolves around converting radian measures to Cartesian coordinates, identifying potential line intersections, and evaluating these intersections in relation to a predefined circle. The core logic of the solution is encapsulated in a series of functions, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the problem-solving process.

## Solution Flow

The code execution follows a structured flow, outlined as follows:

1. **Coordinate Conversion and Mapping:**
   - The solution begins by converting radian measures to x-y coordinates using trigonometric functions. These coordinates represent the endpoints of lines, which are then mapped to corresponding line numbers extracted from an identifier.
   - The mapping results in a dictionary where each key represents a line number, and the associated value is a list containing the coordinates of the line's endpoints, structured as `{line_number: [[start_x, start_y], [end_x, end_y]]}`.
   - **Function Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the total number of points (i.e., `2m`, with `m` being the number of lines).

2. **Intersection Combination Identification:**
   - The next step involves identifying all possible combinations of lines that have the potential to intersect.
   - **Function Complexity:** O(m^2), where `m` is the number of lines.

3. **Intersection Evaluation:**
   - For each pair of potentially intersecting lines, the solution calculates the intersection point and evaluates its distance from a predefined center point.
   - If the distance from the center exceeds a certain threshold (greater than 1, in this case, indicating that the point lies beyond the circle), the function returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1.
   - **Function Complexity:** O(1).

## Total Complexity

Considering the steps outlined above, the total computational complexity of the solution is O(2m + m^2 + 1), which simplifies to O(m^2), where `m` represents the number of lines.
