This Repository contains solution to Problem statement presented by structify.ai.

The Flow of the code is as follows:

1. Convert the radian to x-y coordinates using trignometry and map it to line number extracted from the identifier. Then store everything in dictionary where key is line number and values are coordinates of line points.
   Thus the dictionary would look like {1:\[\[s_1_x, s_1_y]. \[e_1_x, e_2_x]]
